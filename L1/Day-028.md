# Day 28: Git Cherry Pick

## Scenario

The Nautilus application development team is working on `/opt/demo.git`, which is cloned at `/usr/src/kodekloudrepos/demo` on the Storage Server in Stratos DC. There are two branches in this repository: `master` and `feature`. A developer is currently working on the `feature` branch, but needs to merge a specific commit from `feature` into `master` before the rest of their work is complete.

---

## Task

- Cherry-pick a specific commit (with the message `Update info.txt`) from the `feature` branch and apply it to the `master` branch in `/usr/src/kodekloudrepos/demo`.

---

## Solution

### 1. SSH into the Storage Server

```bash
ssh natasha@ststor01
```

---

### 2. Navigate to the Repository Directory

```bash
cd /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/demo
```

---

### 3. Ensure You Have the Latest Changes

```bash
git fetch --all
```

---

### 4. Identify the Commit Hash from the `feature` Branch

```bash
git log feature
```

- Look for the commit with the message: `Update info.txt`.

---

### 5. Cherry-Pick the Commit into `master`

First, check out the `master` branch:

```bash
git checkout master
```

Then, cherry-pick the desired commit (replace `<commit-hash>` with the actual hash):

```bash
git cherry-pick <commit-hash>
```

---

### 6. Push the Changes to the Remote `master` Branch

```bash
git push origin master
```

---

## Result

- The specific commit from the `feature` branch is now included in the `master` branch, without merging unrelated or incomplete work from the `feature` branch.
