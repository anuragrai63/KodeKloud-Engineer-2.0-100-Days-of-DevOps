# Day 4: Script Execution Permissions

## Scenario

To automate backup processes, the xFusionCorp Industries sysadmin team has developed a bash script named `xfusioncorp.sh`. Although the script has been distributed to all necessary servers, it currently does not have the correct permissions for execution by users.

---

## Task

**Grant executable permissions to the `/tmp/xfusioncorp.sh` script on App Server 2. Ensure all users have the capability to execute it.**

---

## Solution

### 1. SSH into App Server 2

```bash
ssh steve@172.16.238.11
```

---

### 2. Set Executable Permissions

```bash
chmod 755 /tmp/xfusioncorp.sh
```

---

## Explanation

- The command `chmod 755 /tmp/xfusioncorp.sh` sets the permissions to:
  - Owner: read, write, execute
  - Group: read, execute
  - Others: read, execute
- This ensures that **all users** can execute the script.

---

**Result:**  
The script `/tmp/xfusioncorp.sh` is now executable by all users on App Server 2.
