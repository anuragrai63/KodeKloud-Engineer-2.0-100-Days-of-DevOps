# Day 35: Install Docker Packages and Start Docker Service

## Scenario

The Nautilus DevOps team is planning to containerize several applications after a recent discussion with the application development team. To begin their testing, they need to:

- Install `docker-ce` and Docker Compose packages on **App Server 2**.
- Initiate (start and enable) the Docker service.

---

## Task

- Install Docker Community Edition (docker-ce) and Docker Compose on App Server 2.
- Start and enable the Docker service.

---

## Solution

### 1. SSH into App Server 2

```bash
ssh steve@stapp02
```

---

### 2. Install Docker CE and Docker Compose

```bash
sudo yum install -y yum-utils
sudo yum-config-manager --add-repo https://download.docker.com/linux/centos/docker-ce.repo
sudo yum install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-compose -y
```

---

### 3. Start and Enable Docker Service

```bash
sudo systemctl start docker
sudo systemctl enable docker
```

---

## Result

- Docker CE and Docker Compose are successfully installed.
- Docker service is running and enabled to start on boot.
