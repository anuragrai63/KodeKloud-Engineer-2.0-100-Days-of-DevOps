# Day 27: Git Revert Some Changes

## Scenario

The Nautilus application development team encountered an issue with the most recent commit in the `/usr/src/kodekloudrepos/demo` Git repository on the Storage Server in Stratos DC. To resolve this, the latest commit needs to be reverted, restoring the repository to the state of the previous commit (which has the initial commit message).

---

## Task

- In the `/usr/src/kodekloudrepos/demo` repository, revert the latest commit (`HEAD`) to the previous commit.
- Use the commit message: `revert demo` (all lowercase) for the new revert commit.

---

## Solution

### 1. SSH into the Storage Server

```bash
ssh natasha@ststor01
```

---

### 2. Navigate to the Repository Directory

```bash
cd /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/demo
```

---

### 3. Revert the Latest Commit (HEAD)

```bash
git revert HEAD --no-edit
git commit --amend -m "revert demo"
```

- `git revert HEAD --no-edit`: Creates a new commit that undoes the changes from the latest commit.
- `git commit --amend -m "revert demo"`: Amends the revert commit to use the required message.

---

### 4. Verify the Commit History

```bash
git log --oneline
```

---

## Result

- The latest commit has been reverted.
- A new commit with the message `revert demo` is now at the top of the commit history, restoring the repository to the previous state.
