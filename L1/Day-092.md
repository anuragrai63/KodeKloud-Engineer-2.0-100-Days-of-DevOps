# Day 92: Managing Jinja2 Templates Using Ansible

## Scenario

One of the Nautilus DevOps team members is working on to develop a role for `httpd` installation and configuration. Work is almost completed, however there is a requirement to add a jinja2 template for `index.html` file. Additionally, the relevant task needs to be added inside the role. The inventory file `~/ansible/inventory` is already present on `jump host` that can be used. Complete the task as per details mentioned below:

- Update `~/ansible/playbook.yml` playbook to run the httpd role on App Server 1.
- Create a jinja2 template `index.html.j2` under `/home/thor/ansible/role/httpd/templates/` directory and add a line `This file was created using Ansible on <respective server> `(for example `This file was created using Ansible on stapp01 in case of App Server 1)`. Also please make sure not to hard code the server name inside the template. Instead, use `inventory_hostname` variable to fetch the correct value.
- Add a task inside `/home/thor/ansible/role/httpd/tasks/main.yml` to copy this template on `App Server 1` under `/var/www/html/index.html`. Also make sure that `/var/www/html/index.html` file's permissions are `0744`.
- The user/group owner of `/var/www/html/index.html` file must be respective sudo user of the server (for example `tony` in case of `stapp01`).

  > **Note:** Validation will run the playbook using the command `ansible-playbook -i inventory playbook.yml`. Ensure the playbook works without any additional arguments.

## Task

- Create `Inventory`.
- Create `jinja2 template & playbook`.

---

## Solution

### 1. Create Inventory like below or use existing one:

```bash
[app_servers]
stapp01 ansible_host=172.16.238.10 ansible_user=tony ansible_password=Ir0nM@n ansible_python_interpreter=/usr/bin/python3 ansible_ssh_common_args='-o StrictHostKeyChecking=no'
```
---

### 2. Create Playbook: (~/ansible/playbook.yml)

```yml
---
- name: Run httpd role on App Server 1
  hosts: stapp01
  become: yes
  roles:
    - httpd


```

---


### 3. Create Jinja2 template (/home/thor/ansible/role/httpd/templates/index.html.j2)

```yml
This file was created using Ansible on {{ inventory_hostname }}

```

---

### 4. Add task in role (/home/thor/ansible/role/httpd/tasks/main.yml)

```yml
---
- name: Deploy index.html from template
  template:
    src: index.html.j2
    dest: /var/www/html/index.html
    owner: "{{ ansible_user }}"
    group: "{{ ansible_user }}"
    mode: '0744'


```

---



## Result

> Check ouput :
```bash
ansible-playbook -i inventory playbook.yml
```
