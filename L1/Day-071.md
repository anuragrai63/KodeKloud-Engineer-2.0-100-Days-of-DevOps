# Day 71: Configure Jenkins Job for Package Installation

## Scenario

Some new requirements have come up to install and configure some packages on the Nautilus infrastructure under Stratos Datacenter. The Nautilus DevOps team installed and configured a new Jenkins server so they wanted to create a Jenkins job to automate this task. Find below more details and complete the task accordingly:

-  Access the Jenkins UI by clicking on the `Jenkins` button in the top bar. Log in using the credentials: username `admin` and password `Adm!n321`.
    
- Create a new Jenkins job named install-packages and configure it with the following specifications:
  - Add a string parameter named `PACKAGE`.
  - Configure the job to install a package specified in the `$PACKAGE` parameter on the `storage server` within the `Stratos Datacenter`.
  

> **Note:**
- Ensure to install any required plugins and restart the Jenkins service if necessary. Opt for `Restart Jenkins when installation is complete and no jobs are running` on the plugin installation/update page. Refresh the UI page if needed after restarting the service.
-  Verify that the Jenkins job runs successfully on repeated executions to ensure reliability.
- Capture screenshots of your configuration for review purposes. Consider using screen recording software like `loom.com` for documentation and sharing.
