# Day 100: Create and Configure Alarm Using CloudWatch Using Terraform

## Scenario

The Nautilus DevOps team has been tasked with setting up an EC2 instance for their application. To ensure the application performs optimally, they also need to create a CloudWatch alarm to monitor the instance's CPU utilization. The alarm should trigger if the CPU utilization exceeds 90% for one consecutive 5-minute period. To send notifications, use the SNS topic named `nautilus-sns-topic`, which is already created.


- Launch EC2 Instance: Create an EC2 instance named `nautilus-ec2` using any appropriate Ubuntu AMI (you can use AMI `ami-0c02fb55956c7d316`).
- Create CloudWatch Alarm: Create a CloudWatch alarm named `nautilus-alarm` with the following specifications:
  - Statistic: Average
  - Metric: CPU Utilization
  - Threshold: >= 90% for 1 consecutive 5-minute period
  - Alarm Actions: Send a notification to the `nautilus-sns-topic` SNS topic.
- Update the `main.tf` file (do not create a separate .tf file) to create a EC2 Instance and CloudWatch Alarm.
- Create an `outputs.tf` file to output the following values:
  - `KKE_instance_name` for the EC2 instance name.
  - `KKE_alarm_name` for the CloudWatch alarm name.

> **Note:**
> The Terraform working directory is `/home/bob/terraform`.
> Right-click under the `EXPLORER` section in `VS Code` and select `Open in Integrated Terminal` to launch the terminal.
> Before submitting the task, ensure that `terraform plan` returns `No changes. Your infrastructure matches the configuration`.

## Task

- Create `Instance`.
- Create `Alarm`.

## Solution

### 1.  Provider.tf

```hcl 
terraform {
  required_providers {
    aws = {
      source = "hashicorp/aws"
      version = "5.91.0"
    }
  }
}

provider "aws" {
  region                      = "us-east-1"
  skip_credentials_validation = true
  skip_requesting_account_id  = true
  s3_use_path_style = true

endpoints {
    ec2            = "http://aws:4566"
    apigateway     = "http://aws:4566"
    cloudformation = "http://aws:4566"
    cloudwatch     = "http://aws:4566"
    dynamodb       = "http://aws:4566"
    es             = "http://aws:4566"
    firehose       = "http://aws:4566"
    iam            = "http://aws:4566"
    kinesis        = "http://aws:4566"
    lambda         = "http://aws:4566"
    route53        = "http://aws:4566"
    redshift       = "http://aws:4566"
    s3             = "http://aws:4566"
    secretsmanager = "http://aws:4566"
    ses            = "http://aws:4566"
    sns            = "http://aws:4566"
    sqs            = "http://aws:4566"
    ssm            = "http://aws:4566"
    stepfunctions  = "http://aws:4566"
    sts            = "http://aws:4566"
    rds            = "http://aws:4566"
  }
}


```



### 3. Update (main.tf)

```hcl

resource "aws_sns_topic" "sns_topic" {
  name = "nautilus-sns-topic"
}

resource "aws_instance" "nautilus_ec2" {
  ami           = "ami-0c02fb55956c7d316" 
  instance_type = "t2.micro"

  tags = {
    Name = "nautilus-ec2"
  }
}


resource "aws_cloudwatch_metric_alarm" "nautilus_alarm" {
  alarm_name          = "nautilus-alarm"
  comparison_operator = "GreaterThanOrEqualToThreshold"
  evaluation_periods  = 1
  metric_name         = "CPUUtilization"
  namespace           = "AWS/EC2"
  period              = 300
  statistic           = "Average"
  threshold           = 90

  alarm_description   = "Alarm when CPU exceeds 90% for 5 minutes"
  alarm_actions       = aws_sns_topic.sns_topic.id

  dimensions = {
    InstanceId = aws_instance.nautilus_ec2.id
  }
}

```

---


### 4. Resource output (outputs.tf)

```hcl

output "KKE_instance_name" {
  value = aws_instance.nautilus_ec2.tags["Name"]
}

output "KKE_alarm_name" {
  value = aws_cloudwatch_metric_alarm.nautilus_alarm.alarm_name
}



```

---



### 6. Run Below

```bash
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply -auto-approve


```

---


## Result

> Check ouput :
```bash
terraform show
```
