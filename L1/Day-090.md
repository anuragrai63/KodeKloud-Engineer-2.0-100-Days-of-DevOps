# Day 90: Managing ACLs Using Ansible

## Scenario

There are some files that need to be created on all app servers in `Stratos DC`. The Nautilus DevOps team want these files to be owned by user `root` only however, they also want that the app specific user to have a set of permissions on these files. All tasks must be done using Ansible only, so they need to create a playbook. Below you can find more information about the task.

- Create a playbook named `playbook.yml` under `/home/thor/ansible` directory on `jump host`, an `inventory` file is already present under `/home/thor/ansible` directory on `Jump Server` itself.
- Create an empty file `blog.txt` under `/opt/finance/` directory on `app server 1`. Set some `acl` properties for this file. Using acl provide `read '(r)' permissions `to `group tony` (i.e entity is tony and etype is group).
- Create an empty file `story.txt` under `/opt/finance/` directory on `app server 2`. Set some `acl` properties for this file. Using acl provide `read + write '(rw)' permissions` to `user steve` (i.e entity is steve and etype is user).
- Create an empty file `media.txt `under `/opt/finance/` on `app server 3`. Set some `acl` properties for this file. Using acl provide `read + write '(rw)' permissions` to `group banner` (i.e entity is banner and etype is group).


  > **Note:** Validation will run the playbook using the command `ansible-playbook -i inventory playbook.yml`. Ensure the playbook works without any additional arguments.

## Task

- Create `Inventory`.
- Create `playbook`.

## Solution

### 1. Create Inventory like below or use existing one:

```bash
[app_servers]
stapp01 ansible_host=172.16.238.10 ansible_user=tony ansible_password=Ir0nM@n ansible_python_interpreter=/usr/bin/python3 ansible_ssh_common_args='-o StrictHostKeyChecking=no'
stapp02 ansible_host=172.16.238.11 ansible_user=steve ansible_password=Am3ric@ ansible_python_interpreter=/usr/bin/python3 ansible_ssh_common_args='-o StrictHostKeyChecking=no'
stapp03 ansible_host=172.16.238.12 ansible_user=banner ansible_password=BigGr33n ansible_python_interpreter=/usr/bin/python3 ansible_ssh_common_args='-o StrictHostKeyChecking=no'
```

### 2. Create Playbook:

```yml
---
- name: Create files with ACLs on app servers
  hosts: all
  become: yes
  tasks:
    - name: Create blog.txt on app server 1
      file:
        path: /opt/finance/blog.txt
        state: touch
        owner: root
        group: root
        mode: '0644'
      when: inventory_hostname == "stapp01"

    - name: Set ACL for group tony on blog.txt
      acl:
        path: /opt/finance/blog.txt
        entity: tony
        etype: group
        permissions: r
        state: present
      when: inventory_hostname == "stapp01"

    - name: Create story.txt on app server 2
      file:
        path: /opt/finance/story.txt
        state: touch
        owner: root
        group: root
        mode: '0644'
      when: inventory_hostname == "stapp02"

    - name: Set ACL for user steve on story.txt
      acl:
        path: /opt/finance/story.txt
        entity: steve
        etype: user
        permissions: rw
        state: present
      when: inventory_hostname == "stapp02"

    - name: Create media.txt on app server 3
      file:
        path: /opt/finance/media.txt
        state: touch
        owner: root
        group: root
        mode: '0644'
      when: inventory_hostname == "stapp03"

    - name: Set ACL for group banner on media.txt
      acl:
        path: /opt/finance/media.txt
        entity: banner
        etype: group
        permissions: rw
        state: present
      when: inventory_hostname == "stapp03"


```

## Result

> Check ouput :
```bash
ansible stapp01 -i inventory -a "getfacl /opt/finance/blog.txt"
ansible stapp02 -i inventory -a "getfacl /opt/finance/story.txt"
ansible stapp03 -i inventory -a "getfacl /opt/finance/media.txt"
```
