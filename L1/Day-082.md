# Day 82: Create Ansible Inventory for App Server Testing

## Scenario

The Nautilus DevOps team is testing Ansible playbooks on various servers within their stack. They've placed some playbooks under `/home/thor/playbook/` directory on the `jump host` and now intend to test them on `app server 2` in Stratos DC. However, an inventory file needs creation for Ansible to connect to the respective app. Here are the requirements:
- Create an ini type Ansible inventory file `/home/thor/playbook/inventory` on jump host.
- Include `App Server 2` in this inventory along with necessary variables for proper functionality.
- Ensure the inventory hostname corresponds to the `server name` as per the wiki, for example `stapp01` for `app server 1` in Stratos DC.

  > **Note:** Validation will execute the playbook using the command `ansible-playbook -i inventory playbook.yml`. Ensure the playbook functions properly without any extra arguments.
