# Day 89: Ansible Manage Services

## Scenario

Developers are looking for dependencies to be installed and run on Nautilus app servers in Stratos DC. They have shared some requirements with the DevOps team. Because we are now managing packages installation and services management using Ansible, some playbooks need to be created and tested. As per details mentioned below please complete the task:

- On `jump host` create an Ansible playbook `/home/thor/ansible/playbook.yml` and configure it to install `vsftpd` on all `app servers`.
- After installation make sure to start and enable `vsftpd` service on all app servers.
- The inventory `/home/thor/ansible/inventory` is already there on jump host.
- Make sure user `thor` should be able to run the playbook on jump host.
  
  
  > **Note:** Validation will run the playbook using the command `ansible-playbook -i inventory playbook.yml`. Ensure the playbook works without any additional arguments.

## Solution

### 1. Create Inventory like below or use existing one:

```bash
[app_servers]
stapp01 ansible_host=172.16.238.10 ansible_user=tony ansible_password=Ir0nM@n ansible_python_interpreter=/usr/bin/python3 ansible_ssh_common_args='-o StrictHostKeyChecking=no'
stapp02 ansible_host=172.16.238.11 ansible_user=steve ansible_password=Am3ric@ ansible_python_interpreter=/usr/bin/python3 ansible_ssh_common_args='-o StrictHostKeyChecking=no'
stapp03 ansible_host=172.16.238.12 ansible_user=banner ansible_password=BigGr33n ansible_python_interpreter=/usr/bin/python3 ansible_ssh_common_args='-o StrictHostKeyChecking=no'
```

### 2. Create Playbook:

```yml
---
- name: Install and configure vsftpd on app servers
  hosts: all
  become: yes
  tasks:
    - name: Install vsftpd package
      package:
        name: vsftpd
        state: present

    - name: Ensure vsftpd service is enabled and running
      service:
        name: vsftpd
        state: started
        enabled: yes


```
