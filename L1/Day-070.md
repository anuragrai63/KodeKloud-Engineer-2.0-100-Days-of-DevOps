# Day 70: Configure Jenkins User Access

Objective

- Configure user access on a Jenkins server using the Project-based Matrix Authorization Strategy.

Prerequisites

- A running Jenkins server accessible from a browser.
- Admin credentials:
  - username: `admin`
  - password: `Adm!n321`

Steps

1. Access and login
   - Open the Jenkins UI (click the Jenkins logo/button on the top bar).
   - Login as `admin` using the password above.

2. Create the user
   - Create a new Jenkins user:
     - Username: `siva`
     - Password: `BruCStnMT5`
     - Full name: `Siva`

3. Configure global authorization
   - Install the "Project-based Matrix Authorization Strategy" plugin if it is not already installed.
   - Go to Manage Jenkins â†’ Configure Global Security.
   - Select "Project-based Matrix Authorization Strategy".
   - Ensure the `admin` user retains the `Administer` permission.
   - Remove all permissions for the `Anonymous` user (if any).
   - Add the `siva` user and grant only the global `Overall / Read` permission.

4. Configure job-level permissions
   - For existing job(s), enable Project-based Matrix Authorization for the job (if using per-job authorization).
   - Grant `siva` only the `Read` permission on the job. Do not grant additional permissions (Agent, SCM, etc.).

Notes

- Plugin installation may require a Jenkins restart. If prompted, choose "Restart Jenkins when installation is complete and no jobs are running".
- After restarting, wait for the Jenkins login page to reappear before continuing. Avoid clicking "Finish" prematurely.
- Capture screenshots or record your steps (for documentation and review). Tools like loom.com can help.

Validation

- Log in as `siva` and confirm the user has only read access to the Jenkins instance and the specified job(s).
- Verify `admin` still has full `Administer` permissions.
- Verify `Anonymous` has no permissions.
