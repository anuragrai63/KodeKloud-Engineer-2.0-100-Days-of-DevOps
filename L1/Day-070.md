# Day 70: Configure Jenkins User Access

## Scenario

The Nautilus team is integrating Jenkins into their CI/CD pipelines. After setting up a new Jenkins server, they're now configuring user access for the development team, Follow these steps:

- Click on the `Jenkins` button on the top bar to access the Jenkins UI. Login using username `admin` and `Adm!n321` password.
    
- Create a jenkins user named `yousuf` with the `passwordRc5C9EyvbU`. Their full name should match `Yousuf`.
- Utilize the `Project-based Matrix Authorization Strategy` to assign overall read permission to the `yousuf` user.
-  Remove all permissions for `Anonymous` users (if any) ensuring that the `admin` user retains overall `Administer` permissions.
- For the existing job, grant yousuf user only read permissions, disregarding other permissions such as Agent, SCM etc.

> **Note:**
- You may need to install plugins and restart Jenkins service. After plugins installation, select `Restart Jenkins when installation is complete and no jobs are running` on plugin installation/update page.
- After restarting the Jenkins service, wait for the Jenkins login page to reappear before proceeding. Avoid clicking `Finish` immediately after restarting the service.
- Capture screenshots of your configuration for review purposes. Consider using screen recording software like `loom.com` for documentation and sharing.
