# Day 72: Jenkins Parameterized Builds

## Scenario

A new DevOps Engineer has joined the team and he will be assigned some Jenkins related tasks. Before that, the team wanted to test a simple parameterized job to understand basic functionality of parameterized builds. He is given a simple parameterized job to build in Jenkins. Please find more details below:
- Click on the `Jenkins` button on the top bar to access the Jenkins UI. Login using username `admin` and password `Adm!n321`.
- Add a `string` parameter named `Stage`; its default value should be `Build`.
- Add a `choice` parameter named `env`; its choices should be `Development, Staging and Production`.
- Configure job to execute a shell command, which should echo both parameter values (you are passing in the job).
- Build the Jenkins job at least once with choice parameter value `Development` to make sure it passes.


> **Note:**
- You might need to install some plugins and restart Jenkins service. So, we recommend clicking on `Restart Jenkins when installation is complete and no jobs are running` on plugin installation/update page i.e `update centre`. Also, Jenkins UI sometimes gets stuck when Jenkins service restarts in the back end. In this case, please make sure to refresh the UI page.
- For these kind of scenarios requiring changes to be done in a web UI, please take screenshots so that you can share it with us for review in case your task is marked incomplete. You may also consider using a screen recording software such as loom.com to record and share your work.
