# Day 2: Temporary User Setup with Expiry

## Scenario

As part of a temporary assignment to the Nautilus project, a developer named **javed** requires access for a limited duration. To ensure proper access management, a temporary user account with an expiry date is needed.

---

## Task

**Create a user named `javed` on App Server 2 in the Stratos Datacenter. Set the expiry date to `2024-01-28`, ensuring the username is all lowercase as per standard protocol.**

---

## Solution

### 1. SSH into App Server 2

```bash
ssh steve@172.16.238.11
```

---

### 2. Create the User with an Expiry Date

```bash
sudo useradd -e 2024-01-28 javed
```

---

## Explanation

- **useradd**: Command to create a new user.
- **-e 2024-01-28**: Sets the account's expiry date to January 28, 2024.
- **javed**: Username, kept in lowercase per company protocol.

---

**Result:**  
A temporary user account `javed` is created on App Server 2 with an expiry date set to 2024-01-28.
