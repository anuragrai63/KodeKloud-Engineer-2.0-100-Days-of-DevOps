# Day 29: Manage Git Pull Requests

## Scenario

Max wants to contribute a new story to a repository, but direct pushes to the `master` branch are not allowed to ensure only reviewed and approved content is merged. Instead, Max must create a pull request (PR) to have his changes reviewed and merged.

Max has already pushed his story, "The ü¶ä Fox and Grapes üçá", to the remote Git repository, specifically to the branch `story/fox-and-grapes`. Now, he needs to create a PR to merge this branch into `master` and have Tom review the changes before merging.

---

## Tasks

1. Confirm the commit history and author information in the cloned repository.
2. Create a Pull Request (PR) from `story/fox-and-grapes` to `master` via the Gitea UI.
3. Assign Tom as a reviewer to the PR.
4. As Tom, review and approve the PR.

```bash
ssh max@ststor01
