# Day 86: Ansible Ping Module Usage

## Scenario

The Nautilus DevOps team is planning to test several Ansible playbooks on different app servers in `Stratos DC`. Before that, some pre-requisites must be met. Essentially, the team needs to set up a password-less SSH connection between Ansible controller and Ansible managed nodes. One of the tickets is assigned to you; please complete the task as per details mentioned below:
- `Jump host` is our Ansible controller, and we are going to run Ansible playbooks through `thor` user from `jump host`.
- There is an inventory file `/home/thor/ansible/inventory` on `jump host`. Using that inventory file test `Ansible ping` from `jump host` to `App Server 1`, make sure ping works.
  
  > **Note:** Validation will run the playbook using the command `ansible-playbook -i inventory playbook.yml`. Ensure the playbook works without any additional arguments.
---

## Task

- Create `Inventory`.
- Run `Module`.

## Solution

### 1. Create Inventory:

```bash
[app_servers]
stapp01 ansible_host=172.16.238.10 ansible_user=tony ansible_password=Ir0nM@n ansible_python_interpreter=/usr/bin/python3 ansible_ssh_common_args='-o StrictHostKeyChecking=no'

```
