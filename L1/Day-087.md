# Day 87: Ansible Install Package

## Scenario

The Nautilus Application development team wanted to test some applications on app servers in `Stratos Datacenter`. They shared some pre-requisites with the DevOps team, and packages need to be installed on app servers. Since we are already using Ansible for automating such tasks, please perform this task using Ansible as per details mentioned below:

- Create an inventory file `/home/thor/playbook/inventory` on jump host and add all app servers in it.
- Create an Ansible playbook `/home/thor/playbook/playbook.yml` to install `wget` package on `all  app servers` using Ansible `yum` module.
- Make sure user `thor` should be able to run the playbook on `jump host`.
  
  > **Note:** Validation will run the playbook using the command `ansible-playbook -i inventory playbook.yml`. Ensure the playbook works without any additional arguments.
---

## Task

## Solution

### 1. Create Inventory:

```bash
[app_servers]

stapp02 ansible_host=172.16.238.11 ansible_user=steve ansible_password=Am3ric@ ansible_python_interpreter=/usr/bin/python3 ansible_ssh_common_args='-o StrictHostKeyChecking=no'
stapp03 ansible_host=172.16.238.12 ansible_user=banner ansible_password=BigGr33n ansible_python_interpreter=/usr/bin/python3 ansible_ssh_common_args='-o StrictHostKeyChecking=no'
```

### 2. Create Playbook:

```yml
---
- name: Install wget on all app servers
  hosts: app_servers
  become: yes
  tasks:
    - name: Install wget package
      yum:
        name: wget
