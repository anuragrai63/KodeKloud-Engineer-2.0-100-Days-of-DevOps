# Day 21: Set Up Git Repository on Storage Server

## Scenario

The Nautilus development team has requested that the DevOps team set up a Git repository for a new application development project. Follow the instructions below to install Git and create a bare repository as specified.

---

## Tasks

- **Install the Git package using `yum` on the Storage Server.**
- **Create a bare repository named `/opt/media.git` (ensure the name matches exactly).**

---

## Solution

### 1. SSH into the Storage Server

```bash
ssh natasha@ststor01
```

---

### 2. Install Git using yum

```bash
sudo yum install git -y
```

---

### 3. Create a Bare Git Repository

```bash
sudo git init --bare /opt/media.git
```

---

## Explanation

- **yum install git -y** installs the Git version control system on the server.
- **git init --bare /opt/media.git** creates a bare repository at the specified path.  
  - A **bare repository** is used for sharing and collaboration (no working directory; suitable for remote centralized storage).

---

**Result:**  
Git is now installed on the Storage Server, and a bare repository `/opt/media.git` has been created as required.
