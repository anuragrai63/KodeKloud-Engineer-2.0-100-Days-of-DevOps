# Day 68: Set Up Jenkins Server

## Scenario

The DevOps team at xFusionCorp Industries is initiating the setup of CI/CD pipelines and has decided to utilize Jenkins as their server. Execute the task according to the provided requirements:


- Install `Jenkins` on the jenkins server using the `yum` utility only, and start its service.

 > **Note:** If you face a timeout issue while starting the Jenkins service, refer to this.
    
- Jenkin's admin user name should be `theadmin`, password should be `Adm!n321`, full name should be `James` and email should be `james@jenkins.stratos.xfusioncorp.com`.

  > **Note:**
  - To access the `jenkins` server, connect from the jump host using the `root` user with the password `S3curePass`.
  - After Jenkins server installation, click the `Jenkins` button on the top bar to access the Jenkins UI and follow on-screen instructions to create an admin user.

## Task

- Connect to the `Jenkins` Server.
- Install Jenkins Using `YUM`.
- Start `Jenkins` Service.
