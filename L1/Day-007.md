# Day 7: Linux SSH Authentication

## Scenario

The system admins team of xFusionCorp Industries has set up scripts on the jump host that run at regular intervals and perform operations on all app servers in the Stratos Datacenter.  
To ensure these scripts run seamlessly, password-less SSH authentication needs to be set up from user `thor` on the jump host to all app servers through their respective sudo users.

---

## Task

**Set up password-less authentication from user `thor` on the jump host to all app servers through their respective sudo users.**

---

## Solution

### 1. Generate SSH Key on the Jump Host (as user `thor`)

```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa
```
- Press Enter to accept the default location and leave the passphrase empty for automation.

---

### 2. Copy the Public Key to Each App Server

```bash
ssh-copy-id tony@172.16.238.10
ssh-copy-id steve@172.16.238.11
ssh-copy-id banner@172.16.238.12
```

---

## Explanation

- The `ssh-keygen` command generates an SSH key pair for the `thor` user.
- `ssh-copy-id` installs `thor`'s public key on each app server, allowing for password-less SSH login.
- This setup enables automation scripts to run remotely on app servers without manual password entry.

---

**Result:**  
Password-less authentication is now configured from user `thor` on the jump host to all app servers via their respective sudo users, enabling seamless script automation.
