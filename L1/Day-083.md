# Day 83: Troubleshoot and Create Ansible Playbook

## Scenario

An Ansible playbook needs completion on the `jump host`, where a team member left off. Below are the details:
- The inventory file `/home/thor/ansible/inventory` requires adjustments. The playbook must run on `App Server 1` in Stratos DC. Update the inventory accordingly.
- Create a playbook `/home/thor/ansible/playbook.yml`. Include a task to create an empty file `/tmp/file.txt` on `App Server 1`.
  
  > **Note:** Validation will run the playbook using the command `ansible-playbook -i inventory playbook.yml`. Ensure the playbook works without any additional arguments.
---

## Task

- Create `Inventory`.
- Create `playbook`.

### 2. Create playbook (/home/thor/ansible/playbook.yml)

```yml

- name: Test playbook on App Server 1
  hosts: app_servers
  become: yes
  tasks:
    - name: Create an empty file /tmp/file.txt
      file:
        path: /tmp/file.txt
